Add/edit templates for ionitron to say.

All the markdown files are run through the response of a [github issue API response](https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/#get-a-single-issue).

Any template you create can be referenced through the id of its path. Examples:

- `templates/forum.md` is referenced by name `forum`
- `templates/a/b/c/deep.md` is referenced by name `a/b/c/deep`
