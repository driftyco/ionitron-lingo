Greetings @<%= user.login %>!

Thank you very much from all of us on the Ionic team for submitting this pull request. We appreciate your commitment to improving Ionic. Unfortunately, we are unable to merge this particular PR, as it may cause regressions or is already out of date with regard to recent fixes. We apologize, as we know how much time you may have put into the work. 

We hope you will continue to contribute to Ionic in the future. Please note that we are more likely to merge a smaller PR that has a passing test and changes only one meaningful feature in the project. Large "all-in-one" PRs are difficult to accept if one of the fixes or features has issues. We recommend submitting two or more smaller PRs, rather than one big one, and please make sure any changes are done to the source code, not the compiled JavaScript or CSS.

Best regards,

Ionitron
