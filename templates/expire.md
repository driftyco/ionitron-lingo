Greetings @<%= user.login %>!

I've closed this issue because my sensors indicated that perhaps it is no longer applicable--or may have already been fixed. However, if you are still experiencing this issue, please feel free to reopen it and provide the following information, so that I may assist you:

- Can you provide a detailed description of this issue?
- How would a robot go about replicating this issue?
- On which platform does this issue occur? (iOS, Android, all, etc.)
- On which platform versions does this occur? (Android 4.2, iOS 8, all, etc.)
- Is this an issue with the Ionic Framework or Ionic CLI?

Additionally, providing a [codepen](http://codepen.io/ionic/public-list/) which replicates the issue is extremely helpful.

If you wish to get help using the framework itself, I recommended visiting [the forum](http://forum.ionicframework.com). The humans there would be delighted to help you.

Thank you for allowing me to assist you.
